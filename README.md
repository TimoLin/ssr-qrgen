ssr-qrgen
=================
This project was based on [shadwosocks-qrgen](http://phoenixlzx.github.io/shadowsocks-qrgen) by [phoenixlzx](https://github.com/phoenixlzx).  

What I did is modified it to support shadowsocksR QR code generation.  

Modified: app.js and index.html   

Todo:
Need to reload the page to generate the new QRcode if you change the config.
